My Entelect R100k Challenge 2013 Entry
======================================

This is the code for my entry for the 2013 [Entelect R100k Challenge](http://challenge.entelect.co.za/).

My bot ended up at the finals, but it was knocked out by some very worthy opponents.

Some of the things you'll find in this distribution:
* `.project` and `.classpath` - I used Eclipse for my development. You can import the `.project` file into your workspace.
* `compile.bat` and `start.bat` - The scripts required by the competition rules for compiling and running the AI, respectively.
* `pom.xml` - The maven POM file if you're not going to use Eclipse.
* `level.txt` - A text file containing a test map (which I used to test my AI with before the test harness became available). You can edit it for some fun.

To run my visualiser run the *test skeleton* class `za.co.wstoop.r100k2013.gui.Skeleton` (after having compiled the source code, naturally).

I have posted a description of how the AI works on the [Wiki](https://github.com/wernsey/battlematrix/wiki)

I dedicate this code to all the people who participated in the competition,
with a special thank you to everyone who participated in our [forum on Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en-GB#!forum/entelect-r100k-challenge)
